Going through new experiences and challenges every other day it is very important to learn to figure out what's the best way to respond and react to those. The way we react represents our character and if very often it is leading us to suffer then it needs a serious shift. It is quite easy to blame external factors for the situation we end up in but we hardly realize that it's due to the choices we made. This leads to a single important question: *How can we make better choices?*
