Things I did right during college @ [Chitkara University](https://www.chitkara.edu.in/) still helps me and all those became the solid foundation of everything I was able to achieve in ~5 years of career so far. Now, I have enrolled into [online MS](https://omscs.gatech.edu/) @ [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/) to prepare for next leg of my career.

During last ~1.5 years at [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/) I've realized the void in my skills to be more fearless in chasing amazing projects happening at Facebook. It's was quite easy to get into comfort zone trap working here and start questioning career choices. Now I have decided to go deep into things I already know(Systems) and try new things completely orthogonal to what I have done so far(Ml/AI/Computer Vision).
