Biggest take away from 2020: being able to think about problems other than health is a big privilege we very often under estimate. We are most of the time worried about either career, relationships, life etc. These are good problems to have as it help us grow as a person irrespective of success/failure. But when we are hit by some health issue all other problems seem pointless. This make very important to proactively appreciate good health and take downtime from other problems while we can.

>  Whatever we are going through it's all probably going to be fine. Just try to keep healthy so we can enjoy when tide turns its side.

I consider myself quite an active person who hits the gym at least 5 days a week and is mindful about diet. Working out is very important for me as it is my ‘Happy Zone’ which helps get the edge off anything and feel good about myself. After 1 month of chronic fatigue and tiredness nothing seems more important to me at the moment than getting back to my usual routine. While now I have started to enjoy this downtime after feeling anxious for days, there are few things which now seems to be of utmost importance to me to maintain good mental health habbits:

* Be kind to yourself: Be patient. If somethings is not going your way and not in your control give it some time.
* Keep mind sane: If something affects our mental health its not worth it. Stuck in thought loop which makes us feel anxious? Short-circuit thought is that nothing is worth our mental health.
* Keep busy: Doing nothing is usually trigger of negative thoughts. I am not a person with a lot of hobbies and find hard to keep myself involved in something all the time. Doing something but being in your problem mentally is also not useful at all. The most useful trick I find to stay involved mentally is to try to be in the moment of trivial things I do. For eg. taking a walk? Take deep breath and try to think about nature around. Observe details about things around. Eating something? Try to feel how every bite feels. Think about that every chew and food going down the body.
* Keep organised: Usually we feel better when we realise things are in our control. Keeping surroundings organised helps get the lost control which makes us feel anxious.
