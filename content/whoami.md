Databases and distributed systems are my fav toys but in general I love hacking around different tech stuff. I'm currently working as Software Engineer at [Facebook](https://facebook.com), London and before this spent good 3.5 years working at [Flipkart](https://flipkart.com), Bangalore. Currently, building worldclass enterprise login of millions of users at [Workplace](https://www.workplace.com/).

Apart from work I love reading, working out and now a days trying to add more stuff into what-i-like list by trying new things. Feel free to [reach out]("https://twitter.com/awked06") if you have any recommendations.
